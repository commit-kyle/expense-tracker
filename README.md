## General info
This is a simple Expense Tracker app.

The user is given an opportunity to add their expenses to the UI to merely be monitored or assessed.
Each expense is differentiated by its title, amount and the date that the expense has been made.

In addition, they are provided with a visual representation of their monetary entries, annually, in the form of a bar chart. Where each entry is given a percentage relevant to the other monetary entries but guided by the expense with the highest value. 
Users also have the functionality to filter through their expenses by year.

Function components are implemented into this project.
